                "\n",
                "The adoption of electric vehicles across the United States is accelerating, transforming the nation’s transportation landscape. As more drivers consider ditching fossil fuels for electricity, the availability of charging stations becomes pivotal—unlike gas stations, chargers aren’t yet ubiquitous. Charging infrastructure is the foundation of this transition; without a reliable, accessible network, widespread EV use simply stalls.\n",
                "\n",
                "This notebook analyzes the EV charging infrastructure across U.S. states, combining charger counts, charger types, and geography with indicators of EV ownership. The goal is to surface where access is strong, where gaps persist, and how infrastructure aligns with adoption.\n",
                "\n",
                "- Coverage: Which states have the highest and lowest concentrations of charging stations?\n",
                "- Density: How does charging infrastructure density vary by state size (e.g., chargers per 100 square miles)?\n",
                "- Accessibility: How does the EVs-per-charger ratio differ by state, and what does it suggest about ease of access?\n",
                "- Technology mix: How are advanced chargers (DC fast chargers) distributed relative to Level 1 and Level 2?\n",
                "- Alignment with adoption: How does infrastructure (counts, density, DCFC share) align with EV ownership levels?\n",
                "\n",
                "After completing this analysis, readers will gain a clear picture of the current state of EV charging deployment across the United States. They will see which regions are best suited for owning an electric vehicle, and understand whether it’s feasible to travel long distances across the country without the risk of being stranded with a depleted battery.\n",
